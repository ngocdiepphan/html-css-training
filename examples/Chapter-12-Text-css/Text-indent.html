    <p class="intro">The <a class="breed" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>,
        or berger de brie, is a large breed of dog traditionally used as
        a herder and guardian of sheep...</p>

    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>Though the Canaan Dog, the national dog of Israel, was AKC-recognized in 1997,
        they aren’t a new breed. In fact, a 2500-year-old cemetery in
        Ashkelon, Israel, contains hundreds of canine skeletons that strongly resemble
        today’s Canaan Dog: a short-haired, prick-eared, inquisitive
        animal with a bushy tail that curls over the back.</p>
