    <h2>Magnolia</h2>
    <p>
        <i>Magnolia soulangeana </i> was originally bred by the <b>French gardener Étienne Soulange-Bodin
            (1774–1846)</b>, a retired
        cavalry officer in <b>Napoleon's</b> army, at his chateau at Fromont near Paris. He crossed Magnolia denudata
        with M.
        liliiflora in 1820, and was impressed with the early flowering of the first seedling in 1826
